This is a simple python scripts which creates a compressed file of a directory using the gzip compression ratio.
After compression is done,file is  uploaded to an FTP server using the current date

This was tested using python 3.5 and 2.7 but should work on most versions.

All suggestions and comments which will make the script better are welcome.
